Custom Processor Design and Implementation

Custom Processor Design and Implementation
Project Overview
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a custom processor. The processor is crafted to support a specific set of instructions, ensuring efficient execution of arithmetic and logic operations. The project encompasses the development of various critical components of a processor, including the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Datapath, Control Unit, and a Finite State Machine (FSM) for controlling operations.

Features
Instruction Set Design: A tailored instruction set that supports fundamental arithmetic and logic operations, ensuring the processor can handle a range of computational tasks.

ALU Implementation: The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is capable of performing basic arithmetic operations (like addition, subtraction) and logical operations (such as AND, OR).

Datapath Architecture: A well-structured datapath that efficiently manages the flow of data within the processor, enhancing the execution speed and efficiency.

Control Unit: An intelligently designed Control Unit that interprets instructions and orchestrates the operation of the processor components in sync.

Finite State Machine: The processor includes a Finite State Machine (FSM) for managing the states and transitions in the processor's operation, ensuring smooth and predictable execution of instructions.
